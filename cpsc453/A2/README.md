1. Open CMD and cd to previous "453VulkanStarter" 
2. git pull origin HW2
3. git stash
4. git stash apply
5. git submodule update --recursive --remote
6. cd build
7. make
8. ./HW2Starter 
to compile the code

I have updated codes of Main.cpp, Object.cpp, starter.frag and starter.vert code to finish the assignment.

In my code, once compile, you can control airplane with Upper Key, Right Key and Left Key, it will be intrinsic right after compile so press c to change to extrinsic and key are same. 
Alphabet O and P are scaling so O will be decreasing and P is increasing the scale
